## Setting up the project
Assuming that we have already installed Visual Studio 2019 and Node.js, here's what we need
to do:
1. Download and install the .NET 5 SDK
2. Check that the .NET CLI will use that SDK version
3. Create a new .NET and Angular project
4. Check out the newly created project within Visual Studio
5. Update all the packages and libraries to our chosen versions

## Installing the .NET 5 SDK
The .NET 5 SDK can be downloaded from either the official Microsoft URL (https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/5.0) or from the GitHub official release page 
(https://github.com/dotnet/core/tree/master/release-notes/5.0).

## Checking the SDK version
> dotnet --help

## Creating the .NET and Angular project
The next thing we have to do is create our first .NET and Angular project
We'll do that using the Angular project template shipped with the .NET SDK as it provides a convenient starting point by adding all the required files and also a generalpurpose configuration that we'll be able to customize later on to better suit our needs.
